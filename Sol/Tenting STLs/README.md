# Sol tenting files
Here are some STL files for 3D printing some tenting feet for Sol. I've included STLs for several degrees options. If you want another angle, you can contact me to add it here. Alternatively, if you have Solidworks, use the .SLDPRT file and change the global variable to your desired angle.
